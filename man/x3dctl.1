.SH DESCRIPTION
x3dctl is a command-line utility for switching AMD X3D CPU operating modes
through the kernel sysfs interface. It allows users to select CPU behavior
optimized for gaming workloads or frequency-intensive workloads.

The tool safely delegates privileged hardware operations to a restricted helper
binary executed via sudo.

.SH COMMANDS

.TP
.B gaming
Switch CPU to cache-priority mode optimized for latency-sensitive workloads.

.TP
.B performance
Switch CPU to frequency-priority mode optimized for throughput workloads.

.TP
.B toggle
Switch CPU mode to the opposite of the current mode.

.TP
.B status
Display the current CPU operating mode.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR -q ", " --quiet

.SH APPLICATION PASSTHROUGH
If an application is specified after a command, x3dctl will change CPU mode
before executing the application.

.SH SECURITY
x3dctl uses sudo to execute a minimal privileged helper binary. The helper
performs validated read and write operations against kernel sysfs controls.
